## Enhanced Annihilation Planes

**Built on [AE2 Extended Life v0.55.22](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ae2-extended-life/files/4724395)**

### Features

- Enchantable Identity Annihilation Planes
  - This means the default Silk Touch behaviour is now gone
  - Though, you can now enchant it with just about any digging-type enchantment and the changes will reflect properly
- Remove drops from being spawned in-world when the block is broken
  - This fixes some lag on both the client & server
    - Client: particle/entity rendering lag
    - Server: entity logic lag
  - Simplifies processing internal logic when checking if drops can fit in the ME storage system
